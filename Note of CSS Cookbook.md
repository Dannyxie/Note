##CHAPTER 1 Using HTML Basics

###Understanding DOCTYPEs and Effects on Browser Layout
- HTML 4.01 has three document types: `Strict`, `Transitional`, `Frameset`
- Both HTML5 and XHTML 1.1 have one document type, but XHTML1.0, like HTML4.01, has three
- The DOCTYPE declaration must appear at the beginning of every web page document

####Quirks mode
-  A web page that is without a DOCTYPE, with an older DOCTYPE, or with a typoriddled DOCTYPE triggers quirks mode.
