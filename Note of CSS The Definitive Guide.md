#CSS: The Definitive Guide

##Chapter 1 CSS and Documents
###Elements
- `Elements` are the basis of document structure.

###Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements
- elements generally take two forms: replaced and nonreplaced

####Replaced elements
- **Replaced elements** are those where the element's content is replaced by something that is not directly represented by document content. such like `img`,`input`

####Nonreplaced elements
- **Nonreplaced elements** mean that their content is represented by the user agent(generally a browser) inside a box generated by the element itself.( This is true of paragraghs, headings, table cells, lists, and almost everything else in XHTML.)

###Element Display Roles
- In addition to replaced and nonreplaced elements, CSS2.1 uses two other basic types of elements: **block-level** and **inline-level**.

####Block-level elements
- **Block-level elements** generate an element box that(by default) fills its parent element's content area and cannot have other elements at its sides.(`p`,`dic`,etc). Replaced elements can be block-level elements, but they usually are not.
- List items are a special case of block-level elements. In additon to behaving in a manner consistent with other block elements, they generate a marker--typically a bullet for unoredered lists and a number for oreder lists--that is "attached" to the element box. Except for the represence of this marker, list items are in all other ways identical to other block elements.

####Inline-level elements
- **Inline-level elements** generate an element box within a line of text and do not break up the flow of that line ( `a`,`strong`, `em`, etc). These elements do not generate a "break" before or after themselves, so they can appear within the content of another element without disrupting its display.
  

- In HTML and XHTML, block-level elements cannot descend from inline-level elements. In CSS, there is no restriction on how display roles can be nested within each other.
- Typically, the XHTML hierarchy works out such that inlines can descend from blocks, but no the other way around. CSS, on the other hand, has no such restrictions.

###Bringing CSS and XHTML Together
- documents are supported to have an internal structure, which is altogether different than a visual structure.
 
###The link Tag
`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="shee1.css" media="all" />`

- To successfully load an external style sheet, **link** must be placed inside the **head** element but may not be placed inside any other element, rather like title. This will cause the web browser to locate and load the style sheet and use whatever styles it contains to render the HTML document.
-  No XHTML or any other markup languague can be included in the style sheet-- only style rules.
- An external style sheet cannot contain any document markup at all, only CSS rules and CSS comments. The presence of markup in an external style sheet can cause some or all of it to be ignored.
- The filename extension is not required, but some older browser won't recognize the file as containing a style sheet unless it actually ends with **.css**. In fact, some web servers won't hand over a file as **text/css** unless its filename ends with **.css*, though that can usually be fixed by changing the server's configuration files.

####Attribute
- type is always set to **text/css**. This value describes the type of data that will be loaded using the **link** tag.

**media** attribute:
	all: Use in all presentational media
	print: Use when printing the document for sighted users and also when displaying a "print preview" of the document.
	screen: Use when presenting the document in a screen medium like a desktop computer monitor. All web browsers running on such systems are screen-medium user agents.

###The style element
- The style element should always start with `<style type="text/css">`, it is possible to be given a **media** attribute.
- The style between the opening and closing style tags are referred to  as the *document style sheet*, or the *embedded style sheet* since this style sheet is embedded within the document. 

###The @import Directive
- `@import url(sheet2.css)`
- `@import` can be used to direct to web browser to load an external style sheet and use its styles  in rendering of the HTML document. `@import` must be placed inside the `style` container
- the style sheets of every @import directive will be loaded and used; (no way to designate alternate style)
- We can restrict imported style sheets to one or more media by listing the media to which it should be applied after the style sheet's URL: `@import url(shee2.css) all;`,`@import url(blueworld.css) screen;`
- External style sheets cannot contain any document makrup, the `link` element can'y be used -- but `@import` can.
- `@import` also directives appear at the beginning of the style sheet. CSS requires the `@import` directive to come before any other rules in a style sheet. An @import that comes after other rules will be ignored by conforming user agents.
- Internet Explorer for Whindows does not ignore any @import directive, even those that come after other rules.

###Backward accesibility

###CSS Comments
`/* This is a CSS1 comment */`

###Inline Styles
- we can't put an `@import` into a `style` attribute
- Use of the `style` attribute is not generally recommended. Indeed, it is marked as deprecated by XHTML 1.1 and is very unlikely to appear in XML languages other than XHTML. Some of the primary advantages of CSS -- the ability to organize centralized styles that control an entire document's appearance or the apperance of all documents on a web server -- are negated when you place styles into a `style` attribute 
	

###Summary



##Chapter 2 Selctors

###Declarations and Keywords
- In the CSS property font, there is exactly one place where a forward slach (/) can be used to seperate two specific keywords. `h2 {font: large/150% sans-serif;}`. This is the only place the slash is allowed to appear in the `font` declaration.




##CHAPTER 6 Text Properties 


###Indenting Text

	text-indent
	Values: <length> | <percentage> | inherit
	Initial value: 0
	Applies to: Block-level elements
	Inherited: Yes
	Percentages: Refer to the width of the containing block
	Computed value: For percentage values, as specified; for length values, the absolute length

- text-align can be applied to any block-level element, but it can't be applied to inline elements or on replaced elements such as images.
-  to “indent” the first line of an inline element, use left padding or margin.


###Horizontal Alignment
	text-align
	CSS2.1 values: left | center | right | justify | inherit
	CSS2 values: left | center | right | justify | <string> | inherit
	Initial value: User agent-specific; may also depend on writing direction
	Applies to: Block-level elements
	Inherited: Yes
	Computed value: As specified
	Note: CSS2 included a <string> value that was dropped from CSS2.1 due to
	a lack of implementation

- text-align does not control the alignment of elements, only their inline content. The actual elements are not shifted from one side to the other. Only the text within them is affected
- IE6 treat text-align:center as if it were the <center> element, and centers elements as well as text. This does not happen in standards mode in IE6 and later, but it persists in IE5.x and earlier.


####text-align:justify
- In justified text, both ends of a line of text are placed at the inner edge of the parent element. Then, the spacing between words and letters is
adjusted so that each line is precisely the same length. Justified text is common in the print world.


###Vertical Alignment
####The Height of Lines
	line-height
	Values: <length> | <percentage> | <number> | normal | inherit
	Initial value: normal
	Applies to: All elements (but see text regarding replaced and block-level elements)
	Inherited: Yes
	Percentages: Relative to the font size of the element
	Computed value: For length and percentage values, the absolute value; otherwise, as specified
