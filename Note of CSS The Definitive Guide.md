#CSS: The Definitive Guide

##Chapter 1 CSS and Documents
###Elements
- `Elements` are the basis of document structure.

###Replaced and Nonreplaced Elements
- elements generally take two forms: replaced and nonreplaced

####Replaced elements
- **Replaced elements** are those where the element's content is replaced by something that is not directly represented by document content. such like `img`,`input`

####Nonreplaced elements
- **Nonreplaced elements** mean that their content is represented by the user agent(generally a browser) inside a box generated by the element itself.( This is true of paragraghs, headings, table cells, lists, and almost everything else in XHTML.)

###Element Display Roles
- In addition to replaced and nonreplaced elements, CSS2.1 uses two other basic types of elements: **block-level** and **inline-level**.
##CHAPTER 6 Text Properties 

###Indenting Text

	text-indent
	Values: <length> | <percentage> | inherit
	Initial value: 0
	Applies to: Block-level elements
	Inherited: Yes
	Percentages: Refer to the width of the containing block
	Computed value: For percentage values, as specified; for length values, the absolute length

- text-align can be applied to any block-level element, but it can't be applied to inline elements or on replaced elements such as images.
-  to “indent” the first line of an inline element, use left padding or margin.


###Horizontal Alignment
	text-align
	CSS2.1 values: left | center | right | justify | inherit
	CSS2 values: left | center | right | justify | <string> | inherit
	Initial value: User agent-specific; may also depend on writing direction
	Applies to: Block-level elements
	Inherited: Yes
	Computed value: As specified
	Note: CSS2 included a <string> value that was dropped from CSS2.1 due to
	a lack of implementation

- text-align does not control the alignment of elements, only their inline content. The actual elements are not shifted from one side to the other. Only the text within them is affected
- IE6 treat text-align:center as if it were the <center> element, and centers elements as well as text. This does not happen in standards mode in IE6 and later, but it persists in IE5.x and earlier.


####text-align:justify
- In justified text, both ends of a line of text are placed at the inner edge of the parent element. Then, the spacing between words and letters is
adjusted so that each line is precisely the same length. Justified text is common in the print world.


###Vertical Alignment
####The Height of Lines
	line-height
	Values: <length> | <percentage> | <number> | normal | inherit
	Initial value: normal
	Applies to: All elements (but see text regarding replaced and block-level elements)
	Inherited: Yes
	Percentages: Relative to the font size of the element
	Computed value: For length and percentage values, the absolute value; otherwise, as specified
