###MIME types
- A MIME type is a textual lable, represented as a primary object type and a specific subtype, separated by a slash.


###URLs

Most URLs follow a standardized format of three main parts:

	1. The first part of the URL is called the *scheme*, and it describes the protocol used to access the resource. This is usually the HTTP protocol
	2. The second part gives the server Internet address
	3. The rest names a resource on the web server.

###Method

|HTTP method | Description |
|----------|------------|
|GET   |   Send named resource from the server to the client. |
|PUT   |   Store data from client into a named server resource. |
|DELETE   | Delete the named resource from a server. |
|POST  |   Send client data into a server gateway application. |
|HEAD  |  Send just the HTTP headers from the response for the named resource. |
